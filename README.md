SecuritySquirrel
================

#Overview

This proof of concept is still under active development and not ready for release, so use at your own risk. We will update this readme in about a month when we are ready to make it usable and public.

If you want to play with it, install the `config.json.sample` file in the same directory as `securitysquirrel.rb` and fill out the template. Then delete `.sample` from the file name.

##Warnings

Since this is a proof of concept under active development, there are a few things to keep in mind:

* I do not currently confirm you set credentials properly in the config file. You will see errors if you don't have everything you need in there.
* There is no error handling, at all. This is only a PoC so if something breaks, it crashes. 
* **Your config.json file has some seriously sensitive credentials in it!** Be careful. Seriously.
