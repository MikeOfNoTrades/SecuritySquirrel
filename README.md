SecuritySquirrel
================

#Overview

This proof of concept is still under active development and not ready for release, so use at your own risk. We will update this readme in about a month when we are ready to make it usable and public.

If you want to play with it, install the `config.json.sample` file in the same directory as `securitysquirrel2.rb` and fill out the template. Then delete `.sample` from the file name.
